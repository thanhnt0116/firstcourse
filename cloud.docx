Week 1:
section-1: Introduction to Cloud Computing
a.Essential characteristics
- On-demand Self-sevice: get access to cloud resources such as the processing power, storage, and network you need, using a simple interface, without requiring human interaction with each provider.
- Broad Network Access: Cloud computing resources can be accessed via the network through standard mechanisms  and platforms such as mobile phones, tablet, laptop and workstation.
- Resources Pooling: give cloud provider economies of scale, which they pass on to their customers, making cloud cost-efficient. Resources dynamically assigned based on demand.
- Rapid Elasticity: you can access more resources when you need them, and scale back when you don't need.
- Measured Sevice: Only pay for what you use or reserve as you go. Resource usage is monitored, measured, and reported transparently based on utilization.
+ Cloud Computing as a Service:
- cost-efficient
- more agile to market change

b. Deployment models
- Public: leverage cloud service over the open internet on hardware owned by the cloud provider, its usage is shared by other companies.
- Private: the cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a single organization. It could run on-premises or it could be owned , managed, and
operated by a service provider.
- Hybrid: mix of both public and private cloud, working together seamlessly.
c. Sevivce models
- Infrastructure(IaaS): you ger access to infrastructure and physical computing resources such as server, networking, storage, and data center space without the need to manage or operate them.
- Platform(PaaS): you ger access to the platform , that is the hardware and software tools, usually those needed to develop and deploy application to user over the internet.
- Software as a Service(SaaS): is a software licensing and delivery model in which software and application are centrally hosted and licensed on a subsscription basis, and sometimes also referred to as "on-demand software".
